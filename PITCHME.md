##JSON - Javascript Object notation

#HSLIDE
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
- JSON is language independent
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

#HSLIDE
JSON is built on two structures:

A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.

##Syntax
JSON data is written as name/value pairs.

A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:

`"firstName":"John"`
